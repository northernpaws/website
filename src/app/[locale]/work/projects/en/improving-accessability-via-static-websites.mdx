## Overview

The goal for this project was to improve the user experience and usability of the company's website, along with boosting the SEO scores. By moving the website from an outdated CPanel-based template to a static HTML website, I improved the SEO scores by over 50%, and we saw increased customer retention and a drop in support tickets.

## Key Features

- **Improved SEO Scores**: Optimizing the website to use a static-generation workflow improved SEO scores by over 50%, especially in speed and accessibility categories.
- **User Experience**: The previous PHP-based website was slow and difficult for users to navigate. The new static site saw a large reduction in support tickets about website issues.

## Technologies Used

- **Alpine.js**: For light-weight interactivity for dynamic website elements.
- **Gulp**: For building the final optimized static website package.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge in this project was establishing a minimal enough website framework to boost the SEO scoring as much as possible, while also supporting elements such as pricing calculated that required interactivity.

Throughout the course of this project, I also learned a lot more about the various components of websites that can greatly effect SEO scoring and accessibility.

## Outcome

The resulting static website improved SEO performance scores by over 50%, saw increased user retention and lowered the bounce rate, and lowered website-related support ticket volume.
